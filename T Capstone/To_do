________

create check to eliminate pins too close to each other

mapViewFilter functionality is kinda shitty. need to adjust it for better results

init for Pin should have default state of isOrigin set to false.


Bugs

switch is broken. very broken.
apparently viewDidLoad is not changing the position of delete view? wtf?
