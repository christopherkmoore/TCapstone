delete all pins function?

mapViewFilter functionality is kinda shitty. need to adjust it for better results

calls for origin -> taking too long, reduce number or set price ceiling
    -> impliment NSFetchedResults updating to tableview. might be nice to not see a black tableView if the user clicks early on the pin.

explication screen.

Bugs
________

BNB VC zooms to wrong when quotes have no origin.

Airbnb listings. shit needs to be cached


Features
++++++++++++++

would be really cool if the API call to airbnb could be triggered by changes in the span, so that when the user scrolls across the mapView, more listings could fill in the empty mapView
